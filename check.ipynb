      "4) If you are going to use a tool that only works on Windows, Mac, or Linux on a (amd64, i386) architecture, perhaps you should say so up front.  I'm running Linux on an ARM64 core and finding out I can't use the tutorial after an hour of coding is really annoying.\n",
      "5) Kind a repeat of item 3... When you mentioned prerequisites, you mentioned GoLang and nothing else.  The 'Postman' agent needs to be run locally for it to work that makes it a prerequisite.  Just saying.  For that matter, you have to have a MYSQL server running for one of your tutorials...
